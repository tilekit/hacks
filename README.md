# Tilekit Hacks

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/tilekit/hacks?quickstart=1)


This repository serves as a tinkering playground and is intended for learning and exploration purposes. Goal is to try lots of things, see what works out, and then gradually improve bit by bit from there.

## Ways

- Each folder should have a specific tinkering task with a corresponding descriptive name, without underscores, dashes please se√±or.
- It is an individual hacker's responsibility to include easy to follow setup instructions in the README for an out-of-the-box tinkering experience.
- Move the hack's status to "Concluded" in this README once the hack is finished, along with a short summary of the results/findings.
- Use `#TODO` markers across the codebase to keep track of ongoing work. Utilize extensions such as [TODO Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) for convenience.

## Concluded

- unified-layer: `wasm_component_layer` crate not feasible as of now. Decided to use `extism` instead.
