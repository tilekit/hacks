# Tilekit Hacks

This repository serves as a tinkering playground and is intended for learning and exploration purposes.

# Ways

- Each folder should have a specific tinkering task with a corresponding descriptive name, without underscores, dashes please se√±or.
- It is an individual hacker's responsibility to include easy to follow setup instructions in the README for an out-of-the-box tinkering experience.
- Move the hack's status to "Concluded" in this README once the hack is finished, along with a short summary of the results/findings.
- Use `#TODO` markers across the codebase to keep track of ongoing work. Utilize extensions such as [TODO Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) for convenience.
